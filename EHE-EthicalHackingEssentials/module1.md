## Our motivation

Sun Tzu, Art of War, “If you know yourself but not the enemy, for every victory gained, you will also suffer a defeat.”
Security professionals must guard their infrastructure against exploits by knowing the enemy— the malicious hacker(s)— **who seek(s) to use the same infrastructure for illegal activities**.

## 1. Why security is needed?

First of all, what is security information? Into security information, we are thinking about information and infrastructure, by which information flows, in a way that theft, tampering, disruption of information or services is kept low or tolerable. **Information security** is about protection or safeguarding of **information and information systems** that use, store, and transmit information **from unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction**.

Information security is needed even more because information systems and business become one thing, the well operation of the companies is supported by information systems. Likely, our lifes even more become supported by information systems. For that, some concepts emerge such as: systems that are focus on ease to use, security of the assets, computers were designed to facilitate research, and this did not place
much emphasis on security as these resources, being scarce, were meant for sharing.

The permeation of computers into both the routine workspace and daily life has led to more control being transferred to computers and a higher dependency on them for facilitating important routine tasks. This has further increased the usage of networked environments and network-based applications. Any network disruptions mean a loss of time, money, and, sometimes, even loss of life. Additionally, the increasing complexity of computer infrastructure administration and management is creating a direct impact of security breaches on the corporate asset base and goodwill.

### Basic core conpects of Information Security

* Confidentiality: it is **the assurance** that the **information is accessible only to authorized**. Confidentiality breaches may occur due to improper data handling or a hacking attempt. **Confidentiality controls include data classification, data encryption, and proper disposal of equipment (such as DVDs, USB drives, etc.)**.

* Integrity: it is the **trustworthiness** of data or resources in the **prevention of improper and unauthorized changes** — **the assurance that information is sufficiently accurate for its purpose**. Measures to maintain data integrity may include **a checksum and access control** **(which ensures that only authorized people can update, add, or delete data)**.

* Availability: it is the **assurance** that the **systems responsible for delivering, storing, and processing information are accessible when required by authorized users**. Measures to maintain data availability can include **disk arrays for redundant systems and clustered machines**, **antivirus software to combat malware**, and **distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) prevention systems**.

* Authenticity: Authenticity refers to the **characteristic of communication, documents, or any data that ensures the quality of being genuine or uncorrupted**. The major role of authentication **is to confirm that a user is genuine**. Controls such as **biometrics**, **smart cards**, and **digital certificates ensure the authenticity of data**, **transactions**, **communications**, **and documents**.

* Non-Repudiation: it is **a way to guarantee that the sender of a message cannot later deny having sent the message** and that **the recipient cannot deny having received the message**. Individuals and organizations use digital signatures to ensure non-repudiation.
